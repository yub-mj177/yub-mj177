## My Learning Goals 
### This Semester

Visit my **website** now using the `www.mangalengome.com` link, it's *super* easy to navigate

[Check out my GitHub](https://github.com/yub-mj177)

Things I want to learn:
- Git and GitHub
- How to build websites
- Python programming

Steps to make a commit in Git:
1. Make changes to your file
2. Stage the changes using `git add .`
3. Commit using `git commit -m "message"`
4. Push using `git push`

| Tool   | Purpose              | Link |
|--------|----------------------|------|
| Git    | Version control      | https://git-scm.com |
| GitHub | Code hosting         | https://github.com |

- [x] Install Git
- [x] Create GitHub account
- [ ] Create a repository
- [ ] Practice commits

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello GitHub!")

greet()
```

> Practice makes progress, not perfection.
